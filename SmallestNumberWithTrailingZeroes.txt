Approach
1. *Understanding Trailing Zeros in Factorial*: The number of trailing zeros in m! is the count of how many times 5 appears in the prime factorization of all numbers from 1 to m. This is calculated by summing m//5 + m//25 + m//125 + ... until the division yields zero.
2. *Binary Search for Efficiency*: Instead of checking every number sequentially, we use binary search to efficiently find the smallest number m such that the number of trailing zeros in m! is at least n.
3. *Counting Trailing Zeros*: For a given number m, the function countTrailingZeros(m) calculates the number of trailing zeros in m! by summing the quotients of m divided by increasing powers of 5.

public class SmallestNumberWithTrailingZeros {

    public static int findSmallestNumber(int n) {
        if (n == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        int low = 0;
        int high = 5 * n; // A safe upper bound
        int answer = 0;
        
        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            int zeros = countTrailingZeros(mid);
            
            if (zeros >= n) {
                answer = mid;
                high = mid - 1;
            } else {
                low = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        return answer;
    }
    
    private static int countTrailingZeros(int num) {
        int count = 0;
        while (num > 0) {
            num /= 5;
            count += num;
        }
        return count;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n1 = 1;
        System.out.println("Input: " + n1 + " Output: " + findSmallestNumber(n1));
        
        int n2 = 6;
        System.out.println("Input: " + n2 + " Output: " + findSmallestNumber(n2));
    }
}


### Explanation
1. *Binary Search Setup*: The binary search is initialized with low set to 0 and high set to 5 * n, which is a safe upper bound because the number of trailing zeros in (5n)! is at least n.
2. *Binary Search Execution*: For each midpoint mid in the search range, the function countTrailingZeros(mid) calculates the number of trailing zeros in mid!. If the count is at least n, we adjust the search to find a potentially smaller number by moving the high to mid - 1. Otherwise, we move the low to mid + 1.
3. *Counting Trailing Zeros*: The helper function countTrailingZeros(num) calculates the number of trailing zeros by summing the integer divisions of num by increasing powers of 5 (5, 25, 125, etc.) until the division result is zero.
4. *Result*: The smallest number m for which m! has at least n trailing zeros is found and returned.

This approach efficiently narrows down the search space using binary search, making it much faster than a linear search, especially for large values of n. The time complexity is O(log(5n)) due to the binary search, and the space complexity is O(1) as no additional space is used apart from a few variables.
